currrenlty using questionbankjp02 for question bank generated by GPTs: Learn Japanese with Mika 🌸 JLPT, Anime, Speak
improvement made by version 2 compared to other versions:
1. all in japanese, no english at all
2. based on JLPT books (at least 100 grammars intended to be included)
3. more questions included (over 300)

How it works:
the python script reads from question bank, the first choice (choice A) is always the correct answer in the question bank before get shuffled by the python script

What it solves:
chatgpt currently (as in Nov 2025) always give the correct answer as A for all questions, so kinda find a way to randomize the correct answer in the choices provided.
